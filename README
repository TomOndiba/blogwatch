Introduction
------------
This plugin allows you to subscribe to blog posts and group topic discussions,
sending you an email whenever a comment is added to a blog post or a reply is
added to a group topic discussion to which you are subscribed. It also adds a
"My Subscriptions" button on your profile status page.

Installation
------------
Download the zip file and extract to your Elgg mod directory. Rename to blogwatch and
enable the plugin in your Elgg's Tool Administration area.

Usage
-----
When you enable the plugin, a new button will appear on all blog post and topic
discussion pages, "Subscribe". If you click the button, it will change
to "Unsubscribe" and another button will appear, "Show subscribers".
If you click on the Show subscribers button, a pop-up window will appear with the
profile icons and names of all users who are currently subscribed to that blog post
or topic discussion.
You will receive an email from the Elgg system when someone comments on the blog post
or replies to the topic discussion.
If you're not interested in the post or topic any more, just click on the
"Unsubscribe" button.

Cron setup
----------
Post notifications are not immediate. Instead, a cron job runs every five minutes
by default and generates the notifications from information recorded in the database.
The following is an example of how to setup the Elgg cron environment.

This is taken from:
